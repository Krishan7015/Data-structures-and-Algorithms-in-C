# 🚀 Krishan's DSA Playground in C

👋 Hello! I'm Krishan, a beginner coding enthusiast exploring the core concepts of **C**, **Java**, and **Python**. This repository is a collection of my early experiments with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, primarily written in **C**, as I build a strong foundation in problem-solving and programming logic.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

This repo showcases beginner-friendly implementations of:

### 🔢 Array Operations
- `arrayinsertion.c` – Insert elements into arrays
- `arraydelete.c` – Delete elements from arrays
- `arraytraversalc.c` – Traverse and display array contents
- `arrayupdation.c` – Update array elements

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- `linearsearch.c` – Basic linear search
- `binarysearch.c` – Binary search with recursion

### 🧼 Sorting Techniques
- `bubblesort.c` – Bubble sort implementation  
  *(More sorting algorithms coming soon!)*

### 📥 Stack Operations
- `stackinput.c` – Push elements onto a stack
- `stackpop.c` – Pop elements from a stack
- `stackpeek.c` – Peek at the top element

### 📦 Queue Operations
- `enqueue.c` – Basic enqueue logic  
  *(Dequeue and circular queue coming soon!)*

## 🚀 My Learning Goals

- Build a strong foundation in **C-based DSA**
- Learn efficient **problem-solving strategies**
- Progress to advanced structures like **linked lists** and **trees**
- Transition into **Java/Python** for real-world applications
- Make this repo beginner-friendly and collaborative

## 📂 Folder Structure (Coming Soon)

Planning to organize code into folders by topic (Arrays, Stacks, Queues, etc.) for better scalability and readability.
