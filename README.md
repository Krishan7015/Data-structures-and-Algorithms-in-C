### 👋 Hello, I'm Krishan

I'm a beginner coding enthusiast currently learning the core concepts of **C**, **Java**, and **Python**. This repository is a collection of my early experiments with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, mainly coded in C, based on my learning from [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm).

### 📘 What to Expect
This repo showcases:
- 🔢 **Array Operations** – insertions, deletions, traversals
- 🔍 **Searching Algorithms** – linear and binary search
- 🧼 **Sorting Techniques** – bubble sort (more coming soon!)
- 📥 **Stacks** – basic push/pop using arrays

### 🚀 My Learning Goals
- Build a strong foundation in C-based DSA
- Learn efficient problem-solving strategies
- Progress to advanced structures like linked lists and trees
- Transition into Java/Python for real-world applications

### ⚠️ Note
Since I'm still learning, there may be mistakes or inefficient solutions. If you spot one, feel free to open an issue or suggest an improvement—I'd really appreciate the help!

### 🙌 Acknowledgements
